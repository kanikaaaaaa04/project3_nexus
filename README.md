# Sentiment Analysis for Customer Reviews

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis tool that can automatically analyze customer reviews to determine the sentiment expressed towards a product or service. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically Naive Bayes classification and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, we build a model capable of classifying text reviews into sentiment categories. The tool provides valuable insights for businesses to understand customer sentiments towards their products or services, thereby enabling them to make informed decisions and improve customer satisfaction.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- We gather a dataset of customer reviews from various sources, such as e-commerce platforms or social media. The dataset should contain reviews and corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).

### Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the text data by removing noise, such as HTML tags, punctuation, and special characters.
- Tokenize the text data into individual words.
- Convert text to lowercase for consistency.
- Handle stopwords to remove common words that do not carry significant meaning.
- Stemming or Lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

### Feature Extraction
- Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical feature vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to represent the text data, which captures the importance of words in a document relative to the entire corpus.

### Model Training
- Train a machine learning model, specifically a Naive Bayes classifier, using the preprocessed and feature-extracted data.
- Naive Bayes is a simple but effective probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.

### Evaluation
- Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation dataset.
- Use classification report to assess performance across different sentiment classes.

### Deployment
- Develop a user interface using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, where users can input text reviews.
- The Flask app exposes a `/predict` route to accept POST requests with JSON payload containing the review text.
- Upon receiving a request, the Flask app preprocesses the text, extracts features, and predicts the sentiment using the trained model.
- The predicted sentiment is returned as a JSON response to the user.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and application development.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library in Python used for implementing Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF vectorization.
- Flask: Web framework for Python used for developing the user interface.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for building user interfaces.
- Docker: Containerization tool used for deployment.

## Expected Outcome
The final outcome of this project is a user-friendly web-based tool for sentiment analysis of customer reviews. Users can input text reviews, and the tool classifies the sentiment expressed in the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The tool provides valuable insights for businesses to understand customer sentiments towards their products or services, enabling them to make informed decisions and improve customer satisfaction.
